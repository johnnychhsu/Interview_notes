## DDIA notes
### Chapter 1
How to measure the server performance? Use percentils would be better than average the client waiting time. For example, the median of 100 times client request processing time.
<br />

3 things we should keep in mind when developing our system:
1. Operability
2. Simplicity
3. Extensibility

### Chapter 2
The reason why declarative lauguage is better for database than imperative language :
1. It is more clear and easy to write and understand the effect of the query
2. It hides the implementation well
