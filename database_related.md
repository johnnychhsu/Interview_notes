### GraphDB
1. Concept
    1. Using graph (nodes and edges) to represent data and its relationship.
    2. Nodes : Can have name, key-value pair **property**. Each node is an entity, this is different from RDB.
    3. Edges : Same as nodes. Link nodes together to represent the relationship between nodes. It is directed.
    4. Label : Both nodes and edges can have label, this is different from property. We can use label to represent the conept of group.
