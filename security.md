## Security issues
### MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm)
1. Variable length data as input, output 128 bits value.
2. There is vulnerabilities, thus should not be used for high security device.
3. Can be used as checksum, to make sure that files haven't be modified by others during tranmitting.

### SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
1. SHA 1~3.
